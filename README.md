The faceted plots above geographically represent the percent of Republican (baseline) representatives the state sends out of the Republican+Democrat elected total with points representing the amount of representatives they send. At first glance, the relative number of representatives each state is sending stays relatively consistent over the years. (i.e. California and Texas are relatively dominating forces in the House.) However, states typically had less diversity in the representatives they were sending in 2022 than in 1976. Compared to a generally purple-ish map in 1976, into the 2000s, the Northeast becomes a Democratic stronghold, while the South and upper Heartland stray increasingly less from Republican representatives over time. This is not only representative of changing geopolitical structures over the years, but also that the American population is becoming more politically polarized. Minnesota and Vermont are two interesting outliers, as they have both had all of their state represented in the House by independent parties. In particular, Minnesota's Democratic Farmer--Labor Party has been one of the most powerful independent party movements in US history, still getting representatives elected until 2018. (Most of the independent representatives in Minnesota are Farmer--Labor.)
